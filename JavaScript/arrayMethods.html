    <h1>Array Methods</h1>
    <p>Array methods are callback functions</p>
    <p>They include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>.map()</li>
        <li>.filter()</li>
        <li>.reduce()</li>
        <li>.sort()</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>All outputs are displayed on the console tab in the inspect section</i></p>
    
    <script>

        // MAP METHOD
        const arr1 = new Array(1,2,3,4,5);
        const map1 = arr1.map(x => x ** 3); // .map() function stores the new array differently from the original one. i.e it creates another array for the new one. It is a callback function

        console.log(map1); // the new array stored in map1
        console.log(arr1); // the original array still displays, which means it was not overwritten



        // FILTER METHOD
        const words = ['name', 'password', 'user', 'precision', 'insist'];

        const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 5) // the filter method also saves the results to a new array. I works based on conditions given in the filter function.

        console.log(result);
        console.log(words);



        // REDUCE METHOD
        const arr2 = [3,4,5,6];
        const arr3 = ['my', 'name', 'is', 'Yusuf']

        const reducers = (reducedResult, currentValue) => reducedResult * currentValue; // reduce method from its name, makes many values combine into a single value.

        const reducer = (reducedResult, currentValue) => reducedResult + ' ' + currentValue; // this works for better the string array which I used to concatenate it

        console.log(arr2.reduce(reducers)); // not only numbers can be used with the reduce method, strings can also be made a sentence with the reduce method.

        console.log(arr3.reduce(reducer)); // any arithmetic operation can be performed with the reduce method.



        // SORT METHOD
        const months = ['Mar', 'Jan' , 'Feb', 'Dec', 'May', 'Oct', 'Jul', 'Sept'];
        months.sort();
        console.log(months) // the output is not based on normal human logic, it is based on the order of the alphabets.

        const arr4 = [4,78,8,90,6,36];
        arr4.sort();
        console.log(arr4) // here, it sorts it in accordance to the position of the first digit on the number counter.

        arr4.sort((a,b) => a - b)
        console.log(arr4); // using this method, the browser will understand that we want it to arrange the numbers in ascending ASCII character order. It works only on Numbers
